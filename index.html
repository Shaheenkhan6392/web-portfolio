<p>As the popular saying goes, “There arent too many chances to make a second first impression.” This is particularly important for web developers, as hiring managers and potential    clients will be looking for the best possible candidate to fill a position or complete a project. A web developer resume should be engaging, and it should communicate your value proposition to potential employers in a clear and concise manner. </p>
